# srmCompound

srmCompound is a small program that auto re-stake your srm balances on FTX, so you don't have to do it.  
Also this acts as a demonstration about the awesome rest API client sample FTX provides that you can play with.

## Usage

I strongly recommend that you use the srmCompound.py script, but the complied version also works.  
Just run the srmCompound script, and leave it running.
